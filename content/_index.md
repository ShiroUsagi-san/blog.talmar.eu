Hello there,  
I'm back from a master degree exchange semester in the [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de), in the ETIT department.  
I'm Mahal, a french **Electronics and Telecommunications** student at INSA Rennes, in last year. My main interests are **low level development, infosec**. I'm also digging antenna design, PCB design and electromagnetism simulation. I was the president of [InsaLan XVI](https://insalan.fr) and former part of the sysadmin team. I launched [@securinsa](https://securinsa.fr) last year with [@MorpheusH3x](https://twitter.com/MorpheusH3x).
