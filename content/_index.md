Hello there, I'm known as Mahal, a french **Electronics and Telecommunications** student at INSA Rennes. My main interests are **low level development, infosec**. I was the president of [InsaLan XVI](https://insalan.fr) and former part of the sysadmin team. I'm also launching [@securinsa](https://twitter.com/securinsa) this year with [@MorpheusH3x](https://twitter.com/MorpheusH3x).

The website contains mainly my [projects](/projects) and [articles](/articles) (mostly in french for now) on topics that I like to dive in.
