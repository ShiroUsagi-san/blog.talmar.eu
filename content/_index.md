Hello there,  
I'm currently following a master degree exchange semester in the [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de), in the ETIT department.  
I'm Mahal, a french **Electronics and Telecommunications** student at INSA Rennes. My main interests are **low level development, infosec**. I was the president of [InsaLan XVI](https://insalan.fr) and former part of the sysadmin team. I'm also launching [@securinsa](https://twitter.com/securinsa) this year with [@MorpheusH3x](https://twitter.com/MorpheusH3x).
