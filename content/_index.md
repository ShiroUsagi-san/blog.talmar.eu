Hello there,  
I'm Mahal, a french **Electronics and Telecommunications** graduated from INSA Rennes. I'm now a PhD student working on radar furtivity. In 2023, I went in germany, in the [TU Darmstadt](https:///www.tu-darmstadt.de), in the ETIT department.

My main interests are **low level development, infosec**. I'm also digging antenna design, PCB design and electromagnetism simulation. I was the president of [InsaLan XVI](https://insalan.fr) and former part of the sysadmin team. I launched [@securinsa](https://securinsa.fr) last year with [@MorpheusH3x](https://twitter.com/MorpheusH3x) and then it dies when I was graduated. 

You may find me also listening or emitting on the waves (mostly short ones). ~~
